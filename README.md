### Library

xtool includes a library that you can use to interact with Apple Developer Services, iOS devices, and more from your own app. You can use this by adding `XKit` as a SwiftPM dependency.

```swift
// package dependency:
.package(url: "https://github.com/xtool-org/xtool", .upToNextMinor(from: "1.2.0"))
// target dependency:
.product(name: "XKit", package: "xtool")
```
